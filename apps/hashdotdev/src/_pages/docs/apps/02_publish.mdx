## Rules for publishers

You must adhere to our publishing rules. This means:

- **Apps must make use of neutrally styled blocks.** See our **block design guidelines**.
- **Apps must not ask users for login credentials.** If third-party access is required, users should authenticate with the Embedding Application via the Auth Hook, or a key should be provisioned for them via the Block Protocol API Middleware.
- **Apps should use or extend common types.** Wherever possible, these should be popular, public types already found in the Block Protocol registry.
