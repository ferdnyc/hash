title: "Setting HASH up"

## On the global network

The easiest way to get started with HASH, or to try it out, is to use the hosted instance at hash.ai

You can sign up for an account at **hash.ai/signup**

## On your own infrastructure

_Instructions here._

If you’re still uncertain about whether HASH is right for you, try signing up for the hosted global network instead. It’s free to sign up for, and will let you get a sense as to what HASH is all about. To learn more about what you’ll be able to do with HASH, read about the Use Cases.

Future plans for self-hosted instances

- Ultimately we plan to make it as easy to run your own HASH instance as it is to install an app locally on your mobile or desktop device. In the meantime, if you’re a less technical user, consider signing up for HASH on the global network instead.
- We additionally plan to allow HASH instances to be connected up to the global network. Self-hosted instances, also known as “federated” instances, will be able to publish and pull information made public by any other instance on the network. Users will be able to stay in control of their own data, fully owning their records, while still easily sharing these with others on a secure, on-demand basis.
